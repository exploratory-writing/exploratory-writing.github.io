	        <p class="lead">
Exploratory writing is a term with no widely agreed upon academic definition. Lee et
al. articulated exploratory writing as "the act of pre-writing for a final writing piece
to examine a writer's own thoughts and beliefs and discover more about his/her inner
mind and connect to the outside world". Pre-writing is a "stage of discovery in the
writing process when a person assimilates his 'subject' to himself". Exploratory
writing, from this perspective, is "thinking-on-paper [...] to discover, develop and
clarify our own ideas". It is a preparatory activity that is conducted to gather
topical and non-topical material in support of the topical progression of a final writing
piece. Murray referred to this activity as "unfinished writing".

          <h1 class="headline display-4 p-4 fw-bold lh-1">What is complex search?</h1>
          <p class="lead">
Exploratory writers engage in complex search tasks. A <strong>complex search</strong> involves complex information
and decisions on how to assess the obtained search results. Such complex search
tasks require a disproportionate amount of attention, because complex informa-
tion needs are different from simple information needs, where users search for single
information elements. As exploratory writing requires reasoning over multiple
pieces of evidence and integrating multiple elements of information, the involved
complex search tasks incur a high cognitive load on the writer.

          <h1 class="headline display-4 p-4 fw-bold lh-1">Contribution</h1>
          <p class="lead">
The design space for exploratory activities is emerging. For
instance, Kittur et al. investigated the costs and benefits of structuring information
during the sensemaking process. In this paper, we provide the first systematic
investigation of exploratory writing from the perspective of exploratory search systems
and complex search for online information. We contribute to shaping the space of
exploratory writing in the extracurricular context of non-fictional writing.

More specifically, we present our studies with <strong>GAS</strong>, an adapted version of the decision
support concept presented by Hosio et al..
GAS allows authors to explore and draw inspiration from a knowledge base of open-ended, subjective data on a specific
topic. Thus, it aims to support exploratory writers in both searching and exploring
information.

          <h1 class="headline display-4 p-4 fw-bold lh-1">Summary of Results</h1>
          <p class="lead">

In our primarily qualitative inquiry, we investigate GAS in supporting
exploratory writing. More specifically, we evaluate how it supports complex search
tasks when writing a short article. The results from our studies validate GAS as a
useful companion to major online search engines in discovering information. GAS
helps writers in developing an idea for an article more quickly than online search
engines. GAS also reduces the time required to explore the space of possible solutions.
Finally, according to self-reported assessment, GAS helps people write articles of
higher quality and with higher confidence. Through participant observation and
qualitative insights, we also contribute a writer-oriented understanding [22] of the
distinct strategies and composing processes that people adopt when searching for
open-ended, subjective information in supporting exploratory writing. Finally, we
discuss our results in light of related work and focus on the challenges that people
encounter when researching a topic online for exploratory writing
